# About the author

My name is [Christian Riesen](http://christianriesen.com/). I've been writing stories even before I could write. I started with crude pictograms on
large drawing paper. Since then my drawing skills haven't improved, but I do hope my stories have.

Living in Switzerland I work as a developer of web pages such as this one but also more intricate applications which can
drive large corporations. Writing code is different from writing prose, but both I find very satisfying. Naturally I
spend a lot of time in front of a screen or another, so I find alternative ways to occupy my mind as well.

When I don't write, or think about writing, I find little, or not so little, side projects to do in my home. Like
welding a metal frame for a coffee table. Or constructing a smart mirror. Or playing with various gadgets and
technologies.
